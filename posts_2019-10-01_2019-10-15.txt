By that time more than 60,000,000 (million) natives were dead.\n\nSo many first nations died that they could not be counted, all through the land the indigenous lay dead everywhere, mostly women and children. The stench was very great and pestiferous. So many were dead, almost like counting the stars, the surviving natives fell victims to rape, murder, enslavement and Spanish raids. The Spaniards (white settlers) took babies from there mothers breast, grabbing them by the feet and smashing there heads against rocks. \n\nThe Spaniards found pleasure in inventing all kinds of odd cruelties. They built a long gibbet, long enough for the toes to touch the ground to prevent strangling, and hanged thirteen [natives] at a time in honor of Christ the Savior and the twelve Apostles. Then, straw was wrapped around their torn bodies and they were burned alive. The chief was captured and burned alive.\n\nOn another occasion, \"The Spaniards cut off the arm of one, the leg or hip of another, and from some their heads at one stroke, like butchers cutting up beef and mutton for market. 40 out of Six hundred, including the cacique, were ordered to be torn to pieces by dogs. Known as (the hounds of hell)\n\nThe island's population of about eight million people, at the time of Columbus's arrival in 1492, already had declined by a third to a half before the year 1496 was out. Eventually, all the island's natives were exterminated, so the Spaniards were \"forced\" to import slaves from other Caribbean islands, who soon suffered the same fate. \n\nThe Caribbean's millions of native people were thereby effectively liquidated in barely a quarter of a century. In less than the normal lifetime of a single human being, an entire culture of millions of people, thousands of years resident in their homeland, had been exterminated.\n\nAnd then the Spanish turned their attention to the mainland of Mexico and Central America. The slaughter had barely begun. The exquisite city of Tenochtitlan [Mexico City] was next.\n\nAll the natives in Florida were exterminated and the land was taken in the name of Christ, as well as the Caribbean lands.\n\nOf course the founders of North America were no different. Although none of the settlers would have survived winter without native help, they soon set out to expel and exterminate the Indians.\n\nIn the spring of 1612, some English colonists found life among the friendly and generous natives.\n\nGovernor Thomas Dale had these settlers hunted down and executed, \"Some he appointed to be hanged some burned some to be broken upon wheles, others to be staked and some shot to death, this was also the punishment for those who wished to act like a native. Those who had no choice in the matter, because they were the native people of Virginia, methods were different. When an Indian was accused by an Englishman of stealing a cup and failing to return it, the English response was to attack the natives in force, burning the entire community down, when ever a white settler was found dead a whole village was burned and hundreds of natives were hung, the chief was burned alive.\n\nOther Indians were killed in successful plots of poisoning. The colonists even had dogs especially trained to kill Indians and to devour children from their mothers’ breasts, this was done until the extermination was near it’s completion.\n\nPeace treaties were signed with every intention to violate them. In 1624, sixty heavily armed Englishmen cut down 800 defenseless Indian men, women and children. In a single massacre in \"King Philip's War\" of 1675 and 1676 some \"600 Indians were destroyed. The pastor later describe the slaughter as been a barbecue. \n98% of the aboriginal race had been wiped off the face of the planet by the 1700’s\n\nEuropeans are white. Spaniards are indigenous to Spain. Therefore Spaniards are white. The Spaniards as a population have some minor mixing with other races throughout their history but they are a majority white European race. They are Iberian's. There are more white settlers in Spain than in the USA.\n\nBefore the arrival of the English, the western Abenaki people in New Hampshire and Vermont had numbered 12,000. Less than half a century later about 250 remained alive, a destruction rate of 98%. The Pocumtuck people had numbered more than 18,000, fifty years later they were down to 920, 95% destroyed. The Quiripi-Unquachog people had numbered about 30,000, fifty years later they were down to 1500, 95% destroyed. The Massachusetts people had numbered at least 44,000, fifty years later barely 6,000 were alive, 81% destroyed.\n\nThese are only a few examples of the multitude of tribes living before Christian colonists set their foot on the 'New World.'

When our organization became active again in 2017, we thought this was a distant hope - now we see this change as a reality! Our goal is to use this critical first step as a way to grow the relationships between our university and Indigenous communities and peoples near and far. We know that this will enrich the experiences of both Native and non-Native students on campus!\n\nThis is dedicated not only to our Native and Indigenous students and allies, but our ancestors and those who came before us. We think of all of the communities of tribes that existed in what is now Denton and we dedicate this to them, especially the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, Caddo, Kiowa and Comanche peoples who once inhabited this land prior to removal. This is for our tribes, communities and relations and for the future generations to come!\n\nPlease join us in spreading this amazing news and congratulating our organization! \nFor more information,

On September 26th, 2019, a whole class of students from Naperville North High School visited for the 6th consecutive year. An interactive presentation followed by Q&A was the highlight of the visit and also an enlivening experience in sharing the philosophy of Krishna consciousness with the students and teachers. As always, everyone received gifts of Bhagavad Gita and Krishna Prasadam. There is no happiness greater than sharing the teachings of Lord Krishna with the next generation of students who would find great value in this ancient Vedic wisdom which could show them the higher purpose of human life. We are happy to welcome many more classes of students in the years to come at Iskcon Naperville Temple.

That includes dry erase markers & highlighters. If you collect the dead markers, they’ll send you a free shipping label & you can ship them back to Crayola to be recycled! Link to get started with this program: http://www.crayola.com/colorcycle.aspx. This program is currently in the US & parts of Canada, check website & www.crayola.com/colorcycle/frequently-asked-questions.aspx - FAQ's.

Odissi Classical Dance performance by Abhinaya Dance Academy at Freedom Mela 2019.\n\nPallavi is a pure dance item in which a raga is elaborated through eye movements, body postures and intricate footwork. Pallavi literally means blooming. This is applicable not only to the dance but also to the music, which accompanies it. Pallavi starts with slow, graceful, lyrical movement of the eyes, neck, torso and feet and slowly builds in a crescendo to climax in a fast tempo at the end. The name of the dance item is always based on the Raaga of the song accompanying it. For example, Basant Pallavi is performed in Basant Raaga and celebrates the advent of spring in all its glory.\n\nPhotography by Suresh K Volam & Kamala Kuricheti  |  Sri Photos  Please like, share and comment our page.  \n\nPlease call (404) 435-3932 for Photos | Videos | 360° Photos | Drone Photos | Drone Videos","expandedLinks":[{"original":"https://www.facebook.com/1089528604478943/photos/a.2301843306580794/2301847119913746/?type=3","expanded":"https://www.facebook.com/1089528604478943/photos/a.2301843306580794/2301847119913746/?type=3"}],"link":"https://www.facebook.com/1089528604478943/photos/a.2301843306580794/2301847119913746/?type=3","postUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/248585699177729/permalink/404862643550033","subscriberCount":0,"score":0.5263157894736842,"media":[{"type":"photo","url":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/s720x720/71261388_2301847126580412_1424632697803767808_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=e007fa&_nc_ohc=65B3BtxYKDgAX_0w7Am&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=1d7e0201bc13a45b8281833cc00211e9&oe=61D64076","height":405,"width":720,"full":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/s720x720/71261388_2301847126580412_1424632697803767808_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=e007fa&_nc_ohc=65B3BtxYKDgAX_0w7Am&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=1d7e0201bc13a45b8281833cc00211e9&oe=61D64076"}],"statistics":{"actual":{"likeCount":8,"shareCount":1,"commentCount":0,"loveCount":1,"wowCount":0,"hahaCount":0,"sadCount":0,"angryCount":0,"thankfulCount":0,"careCount":0},"expected":{"likeCount":3,"shareCount":1,"commentCount":3,"loveCount":1,"wowCount":1,"hahaCount":0,"sadCount":0,"angryCount":0,"thankfulCount":0,"careCount":0}},"account":{"id":11851490,"name":"Atlanta Desis","profileImage":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/cp0/c19.0.50.50a/p50x50/185352871_1941654869343066_145139480419088627_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ac9ee4&_nc_ohc=_RTinB62emgAX_AAxUm&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT8bgnNRa6xI5zYyfQp7KlsMV1Gz_mp179PWzSMKG-q_nQ&oe=61FDC8F9","subscriberCount":3921,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/248585699177729","platform":"Facebook","platformId":"248585699177729","accountType":"facebook_group","pageCategory":"none","verified":false},"languageCode":"und","legacyId":0,"id":"11851490|404862643550033"},{"platformId":"664244497009093_2041518312615031","platform":"Facebook","date":"2019-10-09 20:49:50","updated":"2021-12-11 13:21:44","type":"photo","message":"Hello dear friends !!

Any suggestions and feedback about Miami would be really appreciated.","postUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/156628864375518/permalink/2509376099100771","subscriberCount":3663,"score":0.5263157894736842,"statistics":{"actual":{"likeCount":0,"shareCount":0,"commentCount":10,"loveCount":0,"wowCount":0,"hahaCount":0,"sadCount":0,"angryCount":0,"thankfulCount":0,"careCount":0},"expected":{"likeCount":2,"shareCount":1,"commentCount":4,"loveCount":1,"wowCount":1,"hahaCount":0,"sadCount":0,"angryCount":0,"thankfulCount":0,"careCount":0}},"account":{"id":7860786,"name":"Miami Desis","profileImage":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.18172-8/cp0/c8.0.50.50a/p50x50/10272776_10201935599860813_4659738897096066733_o.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ac9ee4&_nc_ohc=sbqvPG4o1mAAX8fhVga&_nc_oc=AQk_g6yMxaGgCPj1uNvducWpiIdf1Mwc4DAvspWF-RMBTWJ7sQUZ6ZDRKgu0PSD2-lA&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT-aM9PGRrVYAhTac-9v8-Kim8RSl12yYrd1jh13ZMZ2Tw&oe=61FE3DB3","subscriberCount":6921,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/156628864375518","platform":"Facebook","platformId":"156628864375518","accountType":"facebook_group","pageCategory":"none","verified":false},"languageCode":"en","legacyId":0,"id":"7860786|2509376099100771"},{"platformId":"1668827256682858_2480500178848891","platform":"Facebook","date":"2019-10-02 04:00:11","updated":"2021-08-25 10:05:14","type":"native_video","description":"VIGIL HELD TO HONOR DEPUTY SANDEEP DHALIWAL\nDhaliwal's loss is being felt both at home in Houston and in communities around the world.","expandedLinks":[{"original":"https://www.facebook.com/NTVHouston/videos/520790178732994/","expanded":"https://www.facebook.com/NTVHouston/videos/520790178732994/"}],"link":"https://www.facebook.com/NTVHouston/videos/520790178732994/","postUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1668827256682858/permalink/2480500178848891","subscriberCount":6270,"score":0.5263157894736842,"media":[{"type":"video","url":"https://video-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-2/10000000_748217328976931_225889467016151040_n.mp4?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=985c63&efg=eyJybHIiOjU2OCwicmxhIjoxNDU4LCJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InN2ZV9zZCJ9&_nc_ohc=TbYoyXN0F2MAX-kp0iK&rl=568&vabr=316&_nc_ht=video-sea1-1.xx&oh=e24c94e4a5c044e6242476b0a060bb06&oe=6127A585","height":0,"width":0},{"type":"photo","url":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/s720x720/69875053_520803532064992_3131132567256825856_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ad6a45&_nc_ohc=wqLRU5GrCHUAX-6w8m0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=d5f5c2aceb8a4b1054b6458e372b8f82&oe=612A7144","height":405,"width":720,"full":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/69875053_520803532064992_3131132567256825856_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ad6a45&_nc_ohc=wqLRU5GrCHUAX-6w8m0&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=5622c801a8c78d7a0cca9322e85a9e9b&oe=612A4B0C"}],"statistics":{"actual":{"likeCount":2,"shareCount":0,"commentCount":1,"loveCount":0,"wowCount":0,"hahaCount":0,"sadCount":7,"angryCount":0,"thankfulCount":0,"careCount":0},"expected":{"likeCount":2,"shareCount":4,"commentCount":2,"loveCount":1,"wowCount":0,"hahaCount":0,"sadCount":0,"angryCount":0,"thankfulCount":0,"careCount":0}},"account":{"id":7853073,"name":"Dallas Desi Events","profileImage":"https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.18172-8/cp0/c56.0.50.50a/p50x50/11845155_10153088098532104_8276902092566680924_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ac9ee4&_nc_ohc=zTaVsGTnK28AX-44DZO&_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&oh=00_AT9SOCrC4kafmzM6oGBikNqleV9iu3qpt0yne5VxP1Tv4Q&oe=61FCE7F7","subscriberCount":22663,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1668827256682858","platform":"Facebook","platformId":"1668827256682858","accountType":"facebook_group","pageCategory":"none","verified":false},"videoLengthMS":246143,"languageCode":"und","legacyId":0,"id":"7853073|2480500178848891"},{"platformId":"192096177809058_1043587109326623","platform":"Facebook","date":"2019-10-07 06:08:20","updated":"2021-07-27 20:07:13","type":"video","caption":"youtube.com","description":"India used right to reply at UNGA in response to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran khan's speech.

My main motivation for this event is to break our people out of the stigma surrounding this difficult time in many people’s lives. We frown up divorces, we look down at a single women raising a child on her own - because of society, so many men and women (especially women) have a hard time coping with the dark phase in their life. So this event is to support y’all and show that we care for you, that you’re a human being and need the most love through this hard time!! Join us at GUF!!
